One of the standout features of Snap N Search is its commitment to privacy. Unlike many other apps, it doesn't require any storage permissions, ensuring that your data remains secure and private. Additionally, the app itself doesn't require internet access, which means that none of your data is sent anywhere unless you actively choose to use Google Lens, which does require an internet connection.

Using Snap N Search is incredibly simple. Just capture a screenshot of anything you want to explore, whether it's a product label, a piece of text, or even a landmark. The app will then seamlessly integrate with Google Lens, providing you with detailed information, translations, and even the ability to search for similar images or products.
