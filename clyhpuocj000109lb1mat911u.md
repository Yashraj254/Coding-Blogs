### What are Fragments?

In Android, a fragment is a reusable portion of your app's user interface. You can think of a fragment as a mini-activity within an activity. Like activities, fragments have their own lifecycle, meaning they go through stages such as creation, starting, pausing, stopping, and destroying. A fragment receives its own input events, and you can add or remove it while the activity is running.

### Why Use Fragments?

Here are some key reasons why fragments are useful:

1. **Modularity**: Fragments allow you to divide your UI into smaller, manageable pieces. This makes your code easier to manage and maintain.
    
2. **Reusability**: You can reuse fragments in multiple activities, reducing redundancy and saving time.
    
3. **Adaptability**: Fragments help you create flexible UIs that work on different screen sizes and orientations.
    
    For example, a tablet can display multiple fragments side by side, while a phone might show them one at a time.

### How to Create a Fragment?

Creating a fragment is similar to creating an activity. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

1. Create a new class `DemoFragment` that extends `Fragment` and override its methods to insert your app logic.
    

```kotlin
class DemoFragment : Fragment() {

    private val TAG = "DemoFragment"

    override fun onAttach(context: Context) {
        super.onAttach(context)
        Log.d(TAG, "onAttach: Fragment attached to activity")
    }

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        Log.d(TAG, "onCreate: Fragment create")
    }

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        
        Log.d(TAG, "onCreateView: Fragment create view")
       // Inflate the layout for this fragment
        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_demo, container, false)
    }

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)
        Log.d(TAG, "onViewCreated: Fragment view created")
    }

    override fun onStart() {
        super.onStart()
        Log.d(TAG, "onStart: Fragment started")
    }

    override fun onResume() {
        super.onResume()
        Log.d(TAG, "onResume: Fragment resumed")
    }-

    override fun onPause() {
        super.onPause()
        Log.d(TAG, "onPause: Fragment paused")
    }

    override fun onStop() {
        super.onStop()
        Log.d(TAG, "onStop: Fragment stopped")
    }

    override fun onDestroyView() {
        super.onDestroyView()
        Log.d(TAG, "onDestroyView: Fragment view destroyed")
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        Log.d(TAG, "onDestroy: Fragment destroyed")
    }

    override fun onDetach() {
        super.onDetach()
        Log.d(TAG, "onDetach: Fragment detached from activity")
    }

}
```

2. In your activity, instantiate and add the fragment using `FragmentManager`.
    

```kotlin
class FragmentHolderActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private val TAG = "FragmentHolderActivity"
    
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_fragment_holder)
        
        if (savedInstanceState == null) {
        // Get the FragmentManager to interact with fragments associated with this activity
            val fragmentManager: FragmentManager = supportFragmentManager
        // Begin a new fragment transaction
            val fragmentTransaction: FragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction()
        // Create a new instance of DemoFragment
            val fragment = DemoFragment()
        // Add the fragment to the container specified by its ID (R.id.fragment_container)
            fragmentTransaction.add(R.id.fragment_container, fragment)
        // Commit the transaction to apply the changes
            fragmentTransaction.commit()
        }
        Log.d(TAG, "onCreate: Activity created")
    }

    override fun onStart() {
        super.onStart()
        Log.d(TAG, "onStart: Activity started")
    }

    override fun onResume() {
        super.onResume()
        Log.d(TAG, "onResume: Activity resumed")
    }

    override fun onPause() {
        super.onPause()
        Log.d(TAG, "onPause: Activity paused")
    }

    override fun onStop() {
        super.onStop()
        Log.d(TAG, "onStop: Activity stopped")
    }

    override fun onRestart() {
        super.onRestart()
        Log.d(TAG, "onRestart: Activity restarted")
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy()
        Log.d(TAG, "onDestroy: Activity destroyed")
    }
}
```

> Note: The fragment transaction is created only when `savedInstanceState` is null. This ensures the fragment is added just once when the activity starts initially. When a configuration change happens and the activity is recreated, `savedInstanceState` isn't null anymore. In this case, the fragment isn't added again; it's automatically restored from `savedInstanceState`.

3. Include a `FragmentContainerView` in your activity's layout file where the fragment will be placed.
    

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<androidx.fragment.app.FragmentContainerView
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:id="@+id/fragment_container" />
```

**FragmentManager**: The main class to manage fragment operations like adding, removing, replacing fragments, and handling the fragment back stack.

**FragmentTransaction**: Used to perform a set of fragment operations (like adding, replacing, or removing fragments) in a single atomic action.

* **Adding Fragments**: Attach fragments to an activity.
    
* **Removing Fragments**: Detach fragments from an activity.
    
* **Replacing Fragments**: Replace existing fragments with new ones.
    
* **Finding Fragments**: Find fragments by their ID or tag.
    

### Fragment Lifecycle

The lifecycle of fragment goes through the following stages:

1. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1720727885942/05eb5ffe-53d9-4a5d-b5cb-4b2978bcdd5f.png align="center")
    
    **onAttach()**: Called when the fragment is first attached to its host activity.
    
2. **onCreate()**: The fragment is created. The saved instance state can be used to restore the fragment's previous state.
    
3. **onCreateView()**: Called to create the view hierarchy associated with the fragment.
    
4. **onViewCreated()**: Called immediately after `onCreateView()`. You can perform any additional setup of the fragment's view here.
    
5. **onStart()**: Called when the fragment is visible to the user.
    
6. **onResume()**: Called when the fragment is visible and actively running.
    
7. **onPause()**: Called when the fragment is not actively running.
    
8. **onStop()**: Called when the fragment is no longer visible to the user.
    
9. **onDestroyView()**: Called to clean up resources associated with the view.
    
10. **onDestroy()**: Called when the fragment is destroyed.
    
11. **onDetach()**: Called when the fragment has been detached from the activity.
    

* **Lifecycle methods execution when the app is launched** (refer to the code above on how to create a fragment)**:**

This demonstrates the sequence of fragment and activity lifecycle methods executed when the app is launched.

* **Lifecycle methods execution when the app is closed and removed from the background** (refer to the code above on how to create a fragment)**.**

This demonstrates the order of fragment and activity lifecycle methods executed when the app is closed and removed from the background.

### Conclusion
